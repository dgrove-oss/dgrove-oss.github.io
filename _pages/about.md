I enjoy implementing and extending experimental software systems and
pushing the frontier of what is possible.  A recurring theme in my 
research is the pursuit of technology that enables programmers
to more productively construct high performance software systems.

During my career, I have made research contributions in variety of
areas, including the analysis and optimization of object-oriented
languages, virtual machine design and implementation, scalable runtime
systems, Just-In-Time compilation, online feedback-directed
optimization, memory management, and cloud programming models.

Since joining IBM Research in 1998, I have worked on a number of projects, including:

+ My current research focuses on Cloud Programming Models and Serverless Computing. I contribute to [Apache OpenWhisk](https://openwhisk.apache.org/) and serve on its Project Management Committee. In the [KAR project](https://github.com/ibm/kar), we are developing a new fault-tolerant cloud programming model based on actors, reliable message delivery, and principled retries.

+ I helped bring the Swift programming language to Linux as part of the [Swift@IBM](https://developer.ibm.com/swift/) technical team and the [Swift.org](https://swift.org/) community.

+ I co-led the X10 Project. X10 is an object-oriented programming language with integrated support for fine-grained concurrency and distribution. Although originally designed for supercomputers, X10 provides scalable performance and programmer productivity on a variety of systems ranging from single multi-core machines, to the cloud, to high-end HPC-style clusters.

+ I was a member of the Metronome Project, which developed the real-time Java garbage collection technology that became the basis for IBM's WebSphere Real Time product.

+ I am part of the [Jikes RVM](https://jikesrvm.org/) open source community, serving on the Jikes RVM core team and steering committee. Jikes RVM grew out of the Jalapeño research project at IBM. I worked on the Jalapeño optimizing compiler, adaptive optimization system, and other aspects of the VM runtime.

Many of the software artifacts I use in my research are open source. For more information on my contributions to open source, follow [dgrove-oss](https://github.com/dgrove-oss) on GitHub.
